Where Should I Really Go To Eat?

1. Google Maps
2. Get User Location (Phone, Tablet, Laptop, Desktop)
3. Slider for Quality of Restaurant and/or Priciness of Restaurant (Use Yelp Ratings and Cost?)
  a. Can filter out fast food?
  b. Etc.
4. 2 Buttons -> Looks Bad (Generate Another Output), Looks Good (Directions to place in google maps?)
5. Filter Out Certain Restuarants (Coffee shops?, etc)
6. Suggest 1 Restaurant to User based on Quality Slider and Filtered Out 
7. No User Accounts

Long Term: Machine Learning to decide which restuarants are actually good. (If user says that place doesn't look good, negative labelled data for algorithm. If user says that place looks good, positive labelled data for algorithm)
